## Overview

### The Challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the layout on **desktop (≥1025px)**, **tablet (769–1024px)**, and **mobile (≤768px)** screen sizes
- See subtle hover states on each feature card

## My Process

### Built With

- Semantic **HTML5**
- **CSS custom properties**
- **Flexbox** and **CSS Grid**
- **Mobile-first** & responsive workflow
- [Google Fonts - Poppins](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Poppins)

### What I Learned

This project helped me improve my understanding of:

- Combining Grid and Flexbox for responsive layouts
- Creating dedicated **tablet breakpoints** (769–1024px)
- Adjusting spacing and alignment based on screen width
- Elevating card components using subtle box-shadows and transforms

```css
/* Tablet breakpoint */
@media (max-width: 1024px) and (min-width: 769px) {
  .cards {
    grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr;
  }
}
```
